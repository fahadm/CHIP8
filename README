README v 0.1
============
You would need to get SFML2 from here
https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML
and then compile it.

After that you would need to correct all the dependencies in the project.
And finally you would be able to run this.

ISSUES
======
For some reason the hex font is not updated correct.
Need to create a make file to ease the process or better yet make a cmake file.
